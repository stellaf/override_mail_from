# override_mail_from for odoo V10
========================

This module allows you to override all outgoing messages' `from`, `reply_to`, 
values, so that you can use company's smtp server to send out emails.

After installation, set the config parameter `override_mail_from.override_email_from`
to the email address you want to send the mails from.
